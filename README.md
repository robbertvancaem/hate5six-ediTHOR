# hate5six-ediTHOR

Sunny (the guy running hate5six, a hardcore video platform) posted in his Instagram stories that he wrote some code to help him do some grunt work while editing his videos. I took that code and broke it down into some separate methods and added some config parameters that could ease the process. 

Check out https://hate5six.com/ if you're into hardcore/punk music and support him if you can.
